MONTDIJKSTRA ALGORITHM

AUTHOR: ROBERTO PORTILLO TORRES

My C++ implementation for Dijkstra's algorithm for finding shotest path
between two nodes on a graph using an auxiliar heap.

Compile and execute main.cpp file.

Program takes an int as argument. You can test os default graphs
introducing 1 or 2. In other case the aplication will generate
a random graph with the same number of nodes as the number introduced.

After this it will execute Dijkstra's search on this graph.
